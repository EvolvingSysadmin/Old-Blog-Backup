flying.<br /> -To capture pics and images in real time through mobile phone
camera, 5G-wireless capabilities can be coupled to an APP or APK system.<br
/> The -5G fpv wireless range can cover more than 2000 m.<br /> The
aircraft will still handle the telephone and proceed the same way as the
operator.<br /> -It can give stable flight due to its altitude hold mode
function.<br /> - A photographic gesture recognition: gesture in front of
the camera 1-3m from the aircraft.<br /> -Create a route and use the
helicopter to follow it in waypoint flight mode.<br /> -Comes with a
function auto-return. The aircraft shall return to the take-off point
following the GPS trajectory when the control signal is lost.<br /> -When
utilizing a 11.4V 2850mAh battery, the flight time is up to 28 minutes.<br
