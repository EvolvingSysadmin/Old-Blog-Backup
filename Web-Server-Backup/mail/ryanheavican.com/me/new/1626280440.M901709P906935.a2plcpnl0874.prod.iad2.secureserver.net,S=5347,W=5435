stabilisation Pan-Tilt with 110 degrees angle: when utilizing a Pan-Tilt
camera, the tilt angle is 110 degrees.<br /> The position of GPS mode makes
it possible to fly more precise.<br /> 5G wireless capabilities may also be
paired with an APP or APK system in order to record photos and pictures in
real time using mobile phone camera.<br /> The wireless 5G fpv portfolio
may be above 2000 m.<br /> The airplane is still operating the telephone
and the operator.<br /> Due to its altitude mode feature, it can provide a
steady flying.<br /> A reconnaissance of a photo gesture: a gesture 1-3m
from the aircraft in front of the camera.<br /> Create a route to track it
in waypoint flight mode using the helicopter.<br /> It has an auto-return
function. When the control signal is lost, the aircraft must return at the
place of departure following the GPS path.<br /> The flying time is up to
28 minutes when using an 11,4V 2850mAh battery.<br /> Headless mode
eliminates the need to change the aircraft's posture before flying.<br />
With the one-click back option you may return home fast.<br /><br
