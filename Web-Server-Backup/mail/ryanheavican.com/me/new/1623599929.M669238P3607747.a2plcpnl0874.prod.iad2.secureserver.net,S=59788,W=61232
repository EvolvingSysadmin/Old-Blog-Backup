Hi there,
I want to share a message that has been spreading all over the=

internet that concerns the times we are living in. Whether you believe=

in God or not, this is a must read message!
We can see throughout time=
 how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to this point where we are o=
n the verge of a cashless society.
Would it surprise you to know that the=
 Bible foretold of this event?
Don't believe me? This may be the most imp=
orant message you will read
in these times...please do not ignore this!=

This messsage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and the meaning
b=
ehind counting a number people have been pondering for centuries,
666. Th=
is message also shares why Barack Obama is the Antichrist as
well as the =
gospel message. This is truly a message from God!
In the Revelation of Je=
sus Christ given to the apostle John, we read:
...."And he (the false pro=
phet who deceives many by his miracles)
makes everyone=E2=80=94small and =
great, rich and poor, free and slave=E2=80=94to
receive a mark on his rig=
ht hand or on his forehead, so that no one
can buy or sell unless he has =
the mark: the beast=E2=80=99s name or the
number of its name.
This call=
s for wisdom: Let the one who has understanding calculate
the number of t=
he beast, because it is the number of a person. Its
number is 666" (Revel=
ation 13:16-18 CSB).....
Referring to the last generation, this could onl=
y be speaking of a
cashless money society, which we have yet to see, but =
are heading
towards. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or=
 sell
unless we receive the mark of the beast in our right-hand or forehe=
ad.
We could still buy or sell among one another without receiving the
=
mark if physical money was still currency. It logically deduces itself
to=
 this reason.
These verses could not be referring to something spiritual =
because
the word references two different physical locations (our right-h=
and
or forehead) stating the mark will be on one "OR" the other. It once=

again logically deduces itself to this reason.
Here is where it really=
 starts to come together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is concer=
ning the RFID microchip. These are notes
from a man named Carl Sanders wh=
o worked with a team of engineers to
help develop this microchip in the l=
ate 1960's.
Mr. Carl Sanders sat in 17 New World Order meetings with head=
s of
state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the CIA to=

discuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system. The US
gove=
rnment commissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying an=
d controlling the peoples of the world-a microchip that
might be placed b=
elow the skin with a hypodermic needle (a fast,
convenient system that wo=
uld be gradually received by society).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engin=
eers behind him, with US grant
monies provided by tax dollars, took on th=
is mission and designed a
chip that is powered by a lithium battery, rech=
argeable through the
temperature fluctuations in our skin. With out the k=
nowledge of the
biblical scriptures (Sanders was not a follower of Jesus =
at the time),
these engineers spent one and a half million dollars conduc=
ting
research on the best and most convenient spot to have the chip place=
d
within the body.
These researchers determined that the forehead and t=
he back of the
hand (the two locations Revelation says the mark will be p=
laced)
aren't only the most convenient spots, but are also the only viabl=
e
locations for fast, consistent temperature fluctuations within the
sk=
in to recharge the lithium battery. The chip is around 7 millimeters
in l=
ength, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It=
's capable of holding many pages of data about you. All of
your common hi=
story, work history, crime information, health
information, and financial=
 data may be saved on this microchip.
Mr. Sanders believes that this chip=
, which he regretfully helped
design, is the "beast's mark" spoke of in R=
evelation 13:16-18. The
Greek word for "mark" is "charagma," which means =
a "scratch or
etching." Additionally it's interesting to be aware that th=
e number
666 is in fact a word in the original Greek language. The word i=
s "chi
xi stigma," with the last part, "stigma," also meaning "to stick o=
r
prick. Carl believes that is referencing to the usage of a hypodermic=

needle being poked in the human flesh to insert the chip."
Carl asked =
a Boston Medical Center doctor what would happen if the
lithium contained=
 within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The
doctor responded tha=
t if the microchip broke inside a human body, the
lithium would cause a s=
evere and painful wound filled with pus. This
is what the book of Revelat=
ion has to say:
"So the first angel poured his bowl on the earth, and a n=
asty and
terrible sore appeared on the people who had the beast=E2=80=
=99s mark and
worshipped its image" (Revelation 16:2 CEB).
THE HIDDEN M=
EANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!
What I first want to mention, befo=
re I share what the Holy Spirit has
revealed to me concerning the number =
of the beast, is that God
confirms in threes. We can see this throughout =
scripture:
"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, =
the
Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV)=
.
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day
accordi=
ng to the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).
"...Holy, holy, holy, Lo=
rd God Almighty, Who was and is and is to
come!" (Revelation 4:8 NKJV).=

There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three
o=
f them to make the point.
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first gro=
up of three I would
like to point out is that the mark of the beast is de=
scribed in three
separate verses, 16, 17 and 18.
The next three I see i=
s in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed
by three contrasting catego=
ries of people,
1 - "both small and great,
2 - rich and poor,
3 - fre=
e and slave...".
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may =
buy or sell
except one who has...", followed by three explanations of wha=
t one
must have to buy or sell,
1 - "...the mark
2 - or the name of t=
he beast,
3 - or the number of his name".
Now unto verse 18, we read "L=
et him who has understanding
calculate...", which is followed by,=C2=
=A0
1 - "the number of the beast,
2 - for it is the number of a man:
=
3 - His number is 666".
The last three I see is the number "6" being used=
 three times in a
row. The reason I'm making this point about God confirm=
ing in three is
because it is the key to unlocking how to calculate the n=
umber 666.
Throughout the centuries there have been people trying to calc=
ulate
numbers based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to=

identify one person, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do
n=
ot see where God is telling us to count up to 666, but rather to
count th=
e number of the beast. This number is identified as 666. So
the verse is =
telling us to count the number 666.
What does it mean to count? It means =
to add up. So how could we add
up 666? Remember my previous point about G=
od confirming in threes is
key to unlocking the number 666. So logically,=
 what would be the best
way to count the number 666? To count it equally =
by using the rule of
three based off the number.
We cannot count it equ=
ally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back
to the start.
We cannot=
 count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no
zeroes in betw=
een or at the end of 666.
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.
What i=
s interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count
the number i=
tself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in
Revelation Chapter 13), =
being the third verse out of the three verses
that describe the mark of t=
he beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is
18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D=
18, or 6+6+6=3D18.
Another interesting point is the only two other combin=
ations (making
a total of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" =
symbol in
between 666 are:
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.
=
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.
Why the number 144 is w=
orth our attention is because the verse
following Revelation 13:18 is the=
 first time in the Bible where the
144,000 are being described in detail:=

"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with
Hi=
m one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name
w=
ritten on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).
Now if you add up all th=
ree numbers from counting 666 by moving the
"+" symbol around, it would b=
e 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about
the number 162, is, if you div=
ide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The
name of Jesus in Greek gematria adds=
 up to 888. The New Testament was
originally written in the Greek languag=
e. Revelation 14:1 not only
mentions the 144,000, but also the Lamb who i=
s Jesus.
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that=
 if
you apply the same formula that was used to count 666, you get
8+8+=
8=3D24. Why the number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are
24 eld=
ers seated around the throne of God. This is the same throne
where Jesus =
sits.
Now if you take:
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96
=
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96
you get 24+96+96=3D216.
Take 144,000 divided by 216=
 and you get 666.
Remember that this was the same exact formula we used t=
o count the
number 666 that ultimately brought forth the number 888.
He=
re is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirms itself
as be=
ing the true way to count 666:
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=
=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888
3: 8+8+8=3D=
24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216
4: 144,000 div=
ided by 216=3D666
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...
As you can see, it =
is perpetual. And remember that we consistently
used a formula that worke=
d in threes being the number that God uses
for confirmation.
By using t=
he same formulation of counting by adding the plus symbol
in between the =
numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a
manner?
The book of =
Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various
forms. For instanc=
e 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is
interesting about the number =
37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any
number that contains the same s=
ingle digit three times in a row, such
as 111 to 999, it comes out to the=
 value of if you were to add all
three numbers up. For example 888 divide=
d by 37 equals 24. So
8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+=
6=3D18. Could this be
another way of God's word confirming itself that th=
e mystery behind
calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?
Another inter=
esting factor to be aware is that if you add up all the
numbers from 1 to=
 36 (1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as
in three sixes? Could=
 this be a hint that we ought to add up three
sixes as opposed to perceiv=
ing the number as six-hundred sixty six?
Now what may this imply? We all =
know in this world we are recognized
by numbers in various forms. From ou=
r birth certificates to social
security, also with our drivers license, b=
eing recognized founded on a
system of ruler ship. So it is conceivable t=
hat this RFID chip will
comprise a brand new identification that has a to=
tal of 18 characters.
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let hi=
m calculate the
number of the wild beast, number for "of human" it is, an=
d the number
of it 666" (Revelation 13:1, Greek Translation).
The Greek=
 word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of
human" is=
 the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two
definitions of the wor=
d are "a human being, whether male or female",
and, "generically, to incl=
ude all human individuals". Could the number
of the beast apply to all ma=
nkind?
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the Gree=
k
language), and other translations, you will notice the beast is
descr=
ibed as an "it", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this
point is be=
cause when a translation says "His number is 666", this
would imply a sin=
gular person, the Antichrist. But by saying "the
number of it 666", impli=
es that it is of the beast system as a whole.
We can know the number of t=
he beast cannot be to identify products
(like a new barcode) to buy or se=
ll because scripture says we cannot
buy or sell without the number of the=
 beast. What am I getting at?
There will be instances where you could buy=
 something someone made
themselves and it wouldn't have a store branded i=
dentification on it.
But for this number to be in our chips, that is wher=
e it must be to
conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or sell without ha=
ving the
number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Revelation 13:18=
, the
number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", definition
=
"generically, to include all human individuals".
Could this be the identi=
fication of the beast, the number of its
name? The one-world beast system=
 which is recognized by 18 characters?
This may fit the scriptures that s=
peaks of a mark that we must have to
buy or sell in our right-hand or for=
ehead, and that it also includes
the number of the beast, throughout a fu=
ture cashless money society.
Here is another mathematical confirmation: 1=
44,000 divided by 6,
divided by 6, divided by 6 (6,6,6) equals 666. To se=
e many more of
these amazing calculations, read the article about the RFI=
D Mark of
the Beast and the number 666...
Do we believe blind forces ga=
ve us eyes to see? That deaf forces gave
us ears to hear? That careless f=
orces gave us a heart to care for
others? That faithless forces uphold th=
e universe and all the laws
that govern it and that is why we should trus=
t them? That mindless
forces gave us a mind to think and comprehend these=
 things? If there
is a God, He must be personal, because we as His creati=
on are personal
beings. How do we get to personally know anybody? By thei=
r word...The
words of Jesus have been translated into over 2,000 language=
s, and
nothing comes remotely close (the Quran about 110). If that is not=

God's word, nothing is. Why? Why would a personal loving God who
desir=
es for us to know Him, who is all powerful, allow man to create a
word fa=
r surperior than His to be spread around the world throughout
time in so =
many different languages to deceive the world so we may not
know the trut=
h about Him?

"Why did the Biden campaign choose 30330? 2020 divided by 666 =3D
3.0=
330 Who believes this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:6
Someo=
ne said we are being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is
taking =
place between good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literally
(riot=
s, unrest, politics). If you take the current year 2020 and
divide it by =
the number 666 (known for its satanic implications) you
will get the numb=
er 30330 (repeated). This number 30330 happens to be
the number used to v=
ote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Freaky?
Supernatural? Odd for sure. =
Whatever this means, it doesn=E2=80=99t seem
good to me. First, why would=
 anyone knowingly choose those particular
numbers for their campaign? If =
they weren=E2=80=99t knowingly chosen, then
it appears to be a supernatur=
al act by the evil one himself and I
would want to change those numbers A=
SAP. And if the numbers were
chosen knowing their significance, are you s=
atanic? Is this campaign
satanic? Either way I do not believe this is a c=
oincidence. And one
thing is certain, 2020 is truly being divided by Sata=
n. He is the
master deceiver and spreader of chaos. Jesus calls him the f=
ather of
lies."
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, =
and I found
this information:=C2=A0
If you send a text to that number (=
at that time), you would get a
response asking to support Joe's campaign =
to take down Donald Trump,
with one part in caps saying "CHIP IN >>" poin=
ting to a link to go and
donate.
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase =
in the past on his twitter and
people believe it is a subliminal message =
to receive the mark of the
beast, that is to say the implantable RFID mic=
roCHIP that will go IN
our body.
The scriptures warns us in the last da=
ys that a false prophet will
rise up doing miracles to deceive many to ob=
tain the mark of the
beast:
...."But the beast was captured, and with i=
t the false prophet who
had performed the signs on its behalf. With these=
 signs he had deluded
those who had received the mark of the beast and wo=
rshiped its image.
The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake =
of burning
sulfur" (Revelation 19:20 NIV)....
Whatever it takes, DO NOT=
 RECEIVE IT!
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,=
 "If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on hi=
s
forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
t=
he wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His in=
dignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence =
of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of thei=
r torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, w=
ho worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his =
name" (Revelation 14:9-11).
We're residing in very prophetic times with m=
ajor Biblical prophecies
being fulfilled.
When Donald Trump acknowledge=
d Jerusalem as capital of Israel in
December of 2017, this was a big step=
 to fulfill the Third Temple
prophesied within the Bible.
God's Holy sc=
riptures tells us that the Antichrist will seat himself
in this temple:=

"...and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes
=
and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped,
so =
that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he
is God"=
 (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).
Inside the Islamic religion, they have a man re=
ferred to as the
Mahdi, referred to as their messiah who they are eagerly=
 waiting to be
revealed. There are various testimonies from individuals o=
n-line who
imagine this man shall be Barack Obama who is to be the biblic=
al
Antichrist. I have had unusual dreams (you can read them in my article=

on the website above) concerning Barack Obama. He got on stage
declari=
ng himself to be a follower of Jesus with no affiliation to the
Muslim fa=
ith, but was later revealed by his own family members that he
indeed is a=
 religious Muslim.
So what's in the name? The meaning of someones name ca=
n say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has given names to peo=
ple that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name =
Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surfac=
e...
Jesus says, "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning=

from heaven'" (Luke 10:18).
In Hebrew, the word "Barack" means "lighti=
ng", and the usage of
"Bama" (Strongs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used to mean=
 the "heights" of
heaven.
=C2=A0
The following day after the election=
 of Barack Obama (11/04/08), the
triumphing choose three lotto numbers in=
 Illinois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic
state) for 11/5/08 were 666.
Obama =
had been U.S. senator for the state of Illinois, and his zip
code was 606=
06.
These are just a few of many evidences why Barack Obama is the
Anti=
christ. You can see many more in my article on the website above,
as well=
 as read about the dreams I've had concerning this man. I'm
more than con=
vinced that God has shown me that he is without a doubt
the Antichrist, a=
nd we will see him rise to power in the not so
dinstant future.
Why do =
we need Jesus?
"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (=
Romans
2:23).
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is et=
ernal life
in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
Our own works canno=
t save our souls. If we step in front of a judge
in the court of law, bei=
ng guilty for committing a crime, the judge
won't judge us by the good th=
at we have accomplished, but rather the
crimes we have committed. If we a=
s fallen humanity, created in God's
image, pose this type of moral justic=
e, how much greater a perfect,
righteous, and Holy God?
God has brought=
 down to us His moral regulation's by way of the ten
commandments receive=
d by Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guidelines
were not given so we can =
be justified, however so that we might see
the need for our saviour. They=
 are the mirror of God's character of
what He has put in every one of us,=
 with our conscious bearing witness
that we all know that it is an offens=
e to steal, lie, dishonor our
parents, and so forth.
We may strive to o=
bserve all the moral laws of the ten commandments,
however we will never =
catch up to them to be justified before a Holy
God. The same word of the =
law given to Moses became flesh over 2000
years ago within the body of Je=
sus Christ. He was brought forth to be
our justification by perfectly ful=
filling the law, living a sinless
life that solely God could fulfill.
T=
he distance between us and the law can never be reconciled by our
very ow=
n merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and
mercy of =
God. And if we are to seize hold of, by way of faith in Him,
He'll pull u=
s forward being the one to justify us. As within the court
of law, if som=
eone steps in and pays your debt, despite the fact that
you're guilty, th=
e judge can do what is legal and just and set you
free. That is what Jesu=
s did almost 2000 years ago on the cross. It
was a legal transaction bein=
g fulfilled within the spiritual realm by
the shedding of His blood, with=
 His last words being, "...It is
finished!..." (John 19:30).
So why did=
 Jesus have to die for us?
Due to the fact that God is Holy and just, the=
 wrath that belongs to
us could not be overlooked. Through the perfect ri=
ghteousness and
justice of God's character, it must be dealt with, it mus=
t be quenched
and satisfied.
For God takes no pleasure in the demise of=
 the wicked (Ezekiel
18:23). That is why in Isaiah chapter 53, the place =
it speaks of the
coming Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our si=
ns, why it
says it pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.
That is =
due to the fact the wrath that we deserve was justified by
being poured o=
ut upon His Son. For if it was poured out upon us who
deserve it, we'd al=
l perish and go to hell. God created a way of
escape by pouring it out on=
 His Son who's soul could not stay in
Hades, however was raised and seate=
d at the right hand of God in
power.
Now after we put on the Lord Jesus=
 Christ (Romans 13:14), God no
longer looks at the person who deserves Hi=
s wrath, but the glorious
image of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justif=
ying us as if we
obtained the wrath we deserve, making a way of escape fr=
om the curse
of death.
Now what we must do is turn from our sins and be=
lieve in the saviour,
confessing and turning from our sins. That is not j=
ust a head
knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving His word=
s,
taking them to heart. In which we no longer live to practice sin,
ho=
wever turn from our sins and practice righteousness:
"Do you not know tha=
t the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of
God? Do not be deceived=
. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor homosexuals, no=
r sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor =
extortioners will inherit the kingdom
of God. And such were some of you. =
But you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you were justified in t=
he name of the Lord Jesus and
by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corinthians 6:=
9-11).
By doing so we may come to be transformed into the image of God by=

way of faith in His Son Christ Jesus Who is willing to provide the
Hol=
y Spirit to whoever ask of Him:
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, un=
less one is born of water
and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of =
God. That which is born
of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of =
the Spirit is spirit.
Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born=
 again.' (John
3:5-6).
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit,=
 if indeed the Spirit
of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have t=
he Spirit of
Christ, he is not His" (Romans 8:9).
So what are you waiti=
ng for? Our Father in heaven only wants the best
for us all, restoring ev=
ery little thing this world has stolen from
us. That is what it means to =
be "holy". To be made whole.
He's waiting to hear from you. That God give=
n tongue to speak
language, by using faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgi=
ve you by
confessing your sins and be willing to forsake them; that you r=
eceive
the sacrifice of His Son Jesus on the cross, and that you want His=

Holy Spirit residing inside you reworking you into a child of the
livi=
ng God.
Jesus says, "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give hi=
m
(the Holy Spirit) will never thirst. But the water that I shall give
=
him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into
everlasting =
life."
Did you realize that Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone else =
in
the scriptures, even more than He spoke about heaven?! For this very=

cause He was brought forth to die for us, to save us from this place
t=
hat we earned by our sins.
=C2=A0
He describes hell as a actual place w=
here,
"Their worm does not die
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44=
).
And where,
"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13=
:28).
Jesus tells us who to fear,
"And do not fear those who kill the b=
ody but cannot kill the soul.
But rather fear Him who is able to destroy =
both soul and body in hell"
(Matthew 10:28).
"Now I saw a new heaven an=
d a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. =
Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusale=
m, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for he=
r husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabe=
rnacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be=
 His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will=
 wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor =
sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things ha=
ve passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all =
things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and fait=
hful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the=

Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
lif=
e freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, a=
nd I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelievin=
g, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all=
 liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brimst=
one, which is the second death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8).

<body>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I want to share a message that has been spreading all over the internet tha=
t concerns the times we are living in. Whether you believe in God or not, t=
his is a must read message!<br />
<br />
We can see throughout time how we have been slowly conditioned to come to t=
his point where we are on the verge of a cashless society. Would it surpris=
e you to know that the Bible foretold of this event? Don't believe me? This=
 may be the most imporant message you will read in these times...please do =
not ignore this!<br />
<br />
This messsage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and the meaning behind=
 counting a number people have been pondering for centuries, 666. This mess=
age also shares why Barack Obama is the Antichrist as well as the gospel me=
ssage. This is truly a message from God!<br />
<br />
In the Revelation of Jesus Christ given to the apostle John, we read:<br />
<br />
...."And he (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles) makes eve=
ryone=E2=80=94small and great, rich and poor, free and slave=E2=80=94to rec=
eive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one can buy or=
 sell unless he has the mark: the beast=E2=80=99s name or the number of its=
 name.<br />
<br />
This calls for wisdom: Let the one who has understanding calculate the numb=
er of the beast, because it is the number of a person. Its number is 666" (=
Revelation 13:16-18 CSB).....<br />
<br />
Referring to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a cashless=
 money society, which we have yet to see, but are heading towards. Why? Rev=
elation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or sell unless we receive the mar=
k of the beast in our right-hand or forehead. We could still buy or sell am=
ong one another without receiving the mark if physical money was still curr=
ency. It logically deduces itself to this reason.<br />
<br />
These verses could not be referring to something spiritual because the word=
 references two different physical locations (our right-hand or forehead) s=
tating the mark will be on one "OR" the other. It once again logically dedu=
ces itself to this reason.<br />
<br />
Here is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how accurat=
e the Bible is concerning the RFID microchip. These are notes from a man na=
med Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help develop this m=
icrochip in the late 1960's.<br />
<br />
Mr. Carl Sanders sat in 17 New World Order meetings with heads of state off=
icials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the CIA to discuss plans on=
 how to bring about this one-world system. The US government commissioned C=
arl Sanders to design a microchip for identifying and controlling the peopl=
es of the world-a microchip that might be placed below the skin with a hypo=
dermic needle (a fast, convenient system that would be gradually received b=
y society).<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behind him, with US grant monies pro=
vided by tax dollars, took on this mission and designed a chip that is powe=
red by a lithium battery, rechargeable through the temperature fluctuations=
 in our skin. With out the knowledge of the biblical scriptures (Sanders wa=
s not a follower of Jesus at the time), these engineers spent one and a hal=
f million dollars conducting research on the best and most convenient spot =
to have the chip placed within the body.<br />
<br />
These researchers determined that the forehead and the back of the hand (th=
e two locations Revelation says the mark will be placed) aren't only the mo=
st convenient spots, but are also the only viable locations for fast, consi=
stent temperature fluctuations within the skin to recharge the lithium batt=
ery. The chip is around 7 millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in diamete=
r, about the size of a grain of rice. It's capable of holding many pages of=
 data about you. All of your common history, work history, crime informatio=
n, health information, and financial data may be saved on this microchip.<b=
r />
<br />
Mr. Sanders believes that this chip, which he regretfully helped design, is=
 the "beast's mark" spoke of in Revelation 13:16-18. The Greek word for "ma=
rk" is "charagma," which means a "scratch or etching." Additionally it's in=
teresting to be aware that the number 666 is in fact a word in the original=
 Greek language. The word is "chi xi stigma," with the last part, "stigma,"=
 also meaning "to stick or prick. Carl believes that is referencing to the =
usage of a hypodermic needle being poked in the human flesh to insert the c=
hip."<br />
<br />
Carl asked a Boston Medical Center doctor what would happen if the lithium =
contained within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor respon=
ded that if the microchip broke inside a human body, the lithium would caus=
e a severe and painful wound filled with pus. This is what the book of Reve=
lation has to say:<br />
<br />
"So the first angel poured his bowl on the earth, and a nasty and terrible =
sore appeared on the people who had the beast=E2=80=99s mark and worshipped=
 its image" (Revelation 16:2 CEB).<br />
<br />
THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!<br />
<br />
What I first want to mention, before I share what the Holy Spirit has revea=
led to me concerning the number of the beast, is that God confirms in three=
s. We can see this throughout scripture:<br />
<br />
"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and=
 the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to =
the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"...Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" (R=
evelation 4:8 NKJV).<br />
<br />
There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three of the=
m to make the point.<br />
<br />
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first group of three I would like to =
point out is that the mark of the beast is described in three separate vers=
es, 16, 17 and 18.<br />
<br />
The next three I see is in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed by thre=
e contrasting categories of people,<br />
<br />
1 - "both small and great,<br />
2 - rich and poor,<br />
3 - free and slave...".<br />
<br />
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may buy or sell except =
one who has...", followed by three explanations of what one must have to bu=
y or sell,<br />
<br />
1 - "...the mark<br />
2 - or the name of the beast,<br />
3 - or the number of his name".<br />
<br />
Now unto verse 18, we read "Let him who has understanding calculate...", wh=
ich is followed by,=C2=A0<br />
<br />
1 - "the number of the beast,<br />
2 - for it is the number of a man:<br />
3 - His number is 666".<br />
<br />
The last three I see is the number "6" being used three times in a row. The=
 reason I'm making this point about God confirming in three is because it i=
s the key to unlocking how to calculate the number 666.<br />
<br />
Throughout the centuries there have been people trying to calculate numbers=
 based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to identify one p=
erson, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do not see where God is=
 telling us to count up to 666, but rather to count the number of the beast=
. This number is identified as 666. So the verse is telling us to count the=
 number 666.<br />
<br />
What does it mean to count? It means to add up. So how could we add up 666?=
 Remember my previous point about God confirming in threes is key to unlock=
ing the number 666. So logically, what would be the best way to count the n=
umber 666? To count it equally by using the rule of three based off the num=
ber.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back to th=
e start.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no zeroes =
in between or at the end of 666.<br />
<br />
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
What is interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count the numb=
er itself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in Revelation Chapter 13)=
, being the third verse out of the three verses that describe the mark of t=
he beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is 18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D18=
, or 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
Another interesting point is the only two other combinations (making a tota=
l of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" symbol in between 666 a=
re:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.<br />
<br />
Why the number 144 is worth our attention is because the verse following Re=
velation 13:18 is the first time in the Bible where the 144,000 are being d=
escribed in detail:<br />
<br />
"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one=
 hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name written =
on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).<br />
<br />
Now if you add up all three numbers from counting 666 by moving the "+" sym=
bol around, it would be 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about the number=
 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The name of Jesus in G=
reek gematria adds up to 888. The New Testament was originally written in t=
he Greek language. Revelation 14:1 not only mentions the 144,000, but also =
the Lamb who is Jesus.<br />
<br />
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that if you app=
ly the same formula that was used to count 666, you get 8+8+8=3D24. Why the=
 number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are 24 elders seated around=
 the throne of God. This is the same throne where Jesus sits.<br />
<br />
Now if you take:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96<br />
<br />
you get 24+96+96=3D216.<br />
<br />
Take 144,000 divided by 216 and you get 666.<br />
<br />
Remember that this was the same exact formula we used to count the number 6=
66 that ultimately brought forth the number 888.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirms itself as be=
ing the true way to count 666:<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162<br />
<br />
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888<br />
<br />
3: 8+8+8=3D24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216<br />
<br />
4: 144,000 divided by 216=3D666<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is perpetual. And remember that we consistently used a f=
ormula that worked in threes being the number that God uses for confirmatio=
n.<br />
<br />
By using the same formulation of counting by adding the plus symbol in betw=
een the numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a manner?<br />
<br />
The book of Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various forms. F=
or instance 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is interesting about the=
 number 37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any number that contains the =
same single digit three times in a row, such as 111 to 999, it comes out to=
 the value of if you were to add all three numbers up. For example 888 divi=
ded by 37 equals 24. So 8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+=
6=3D18. Could this be another way of God's word confirming itself that the =
mystery behind calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?<br />
<br />
Another interesting factor to be aware is that if you add up all the number=
s from 1 to 36 (1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as in three six=
es? Could this be a hint that we ought to add up three sixes as opposed to =
perceiving the number as six-hundred sixty six?<br />
<br />
Now what may this imply? We all know in this world we are recognized by num=
bers in various forms. From our birth certificates to social security, also=
 with our drivers license, being recognized founded on a system of ruler sh=
ip. So it is conceivable that this RFID chip will comprise a brand new iden=
tification that has a total of 18 characters.<br />
<br />
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let him calculate the number o=
f the wild beast, number for "of human" it is, and the number of it 666" (R=
evelation 13:1, Greek Translation).<br />
<br />
The Greek word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of hu=
man" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two definitions of th=
e word are "a human being, whether male or female", and, "generically, to i=
nclude all human individuals". Could the number of the beast apply to all m=
ankind?<br />
<br />
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the Greek languag=
e), and other translations, you will notice the beast is described as an "i=
t", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this point is because when a tr=
anslation says "His number is 666", this would imply a singular person, the=
 Antichrist. But by saying "the number of it 666", implies that it is of th=
e beast system as a whole.<br />
<br />
We can know the number of the beast cannot be to identify products (like a =
new barcode) to buy or sell because scripture says we cannot buy or sell wi=
thout the number of the beast. What am I getting at? There will be instance=
s where you could buy something someone made themselves and it wouldn't hav=
e a store branded identification on it. But for this number to be in our ch=
ips, that is where it must be to conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or =
sell without having the number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Rev=
elation 13:18, the number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", de=
finition "generically, to include all human individuals".<br />
<br />
Could this be the identification of the beast, the number of its name? The =
one-world beast system which is recognized by 18 characters? This may fit t=
he scriptures that speaks of a mark that we must have to buy or sell in our=
 right-hand or forehead, and that it also includes the number of the beast,=
 throughout a future cashless money society.<br />
<br />
Here is another mathematical confirmation: 144,000 divided by 6, divided by=
 6, divided by 6 (6,6,6) equals 666. To see many more of these amazing calc=
ulations, read the article about the RFID Mark of the Beast and the number =
666...<br />
<br />
Do we believe blind forces gave us eyes to see? That deaf forces gave us ea=
rs to hear? That careless forces gave us a heart to care for others? That f=
aithless forces uphold the universe and all the laws that govern it and tha=
t is why we should trust them? That mindless forces gave us a mind to think=
 and comprehend these things? If there is a God, He must be personal, becau=
se we as His creation are personal beings. How do we get to personally know=
 anybody? By their word...The words of Jesus have been translated into over=
 2,000 languages, and nothing comes remotely close (the Quran about 110). I=
f that is not God's word, nothing is. Why? Why would a personal loving God =
who desires for us to know Him, who is all powerful, allow man to create a =
word far surperior than His to be spread around the world throughout time i=
n so many different languages to deceive the world so we may not know the t=
ruth about Him?<br />

So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, and I found this inf=
ormation:=C2=A0<br />
<br />
If you send a text to that number (at that time), you would get a response =
asking to support Joe's campaign to take down Donald Trump, with one part i=
n caps saying "CHIP IN >>" pointing to a link to go and donate.<br />
<br />
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase in the past on his twitter and people=
 believe it is a subliminal message to receive the mark of the beast, that =
is to say the implantable RFID microCHIP that will go IN our body.<br />
<br />
The scriptures warns us in the last days that a false prophet will rise up =
doing miracles to deceive many to obtain the mark of the beast:<br />
<br />
...."But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had perf=
ormed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who ha=
d received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them w=
ere thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur" (Revelation 19:20 N=
IV)....<br />
<br />
Whatever it takes, DO NOT RECEIVE IT!<br />
<br />
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone wor=
ships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on =
his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, whic=
h is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be =
tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in=
 the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever a=
nd ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his =
image, and whoever receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11).<br =
/>
<br />
We're residing in very prophetic times with major Biblical prophecies being=
 fulfilled.<br />
<br />
When Donald Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as capital of Israel in December o=
f 2017, this was a big step to fulfill the Third Temple prophesied within t=
he Bible.<br />
<br />
God's Holy scriptures tells us that the Antichrist will seat himself in thi=
s temple:<br />
<br />
"...and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and e=
xalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he=
 sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God" (2 Thess=
alonians 2:3-4).<br />
<br />
Inside the Islamic religion, they have a man referred to as the Mahdi, refe=
rred to as their messiah who they are eagerly waiting to be revealed. There=
 are various testimonies from individuals on-line who imagine this man shal=
l be Barack Obama who is to be the biblical Antichrist. I have had unusual =
dreams (you can read them in my article on the website above) concerning Ba=
rack Obama. He got on stage declaring himself to be a follower of Jesus wit=
h no affiliation to the Muslim faith, but was later revealed by his own fam=
ily members that he indeed is a religious Muslim.<br />
<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someones name can say a lot about a p=
erson. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specifi=
c meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us take=
 a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface...<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from hea=
ven'" (Luke 10:18).<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the word "Barack" means "lighting", and the usage of "Bama" (Str=
ongs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used to mean the "heights" of heaven.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
The following day after the election of Barack Obama (11/04/08), the triump=
hing choose three lotto numbers in Illinois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic state=
) for 11/5/08 were 666.<br />
<br />
Obama had been U.S. senator for the state of Illinois, and his zip code was=
 60606.<br />
<br />
These are just a few of many evidences why Barack Obama is the Antichrist. =
You can see many more in my article on the website above, as well as read a=
bout the dreams I've had concerning this man. I'm more than convinced that =
God has shown me that he is without a doubt the Antichrist, and we will see=
 him rise to power in the not so dinstant future.<br />
<br />
Why do we need Jesus?<br />
<br />
"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 2:23).<br =
/>
<br />
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Chri=
st Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).<br />
<br />
Our own works cannot save our souls. If we step in front of a judge in the =
court of law, being guilty for committing a crime, the judge won't judge us=
 by the good that we have accomplished, but rather the crimes we have commi=
tted. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's image, pose this type of m=
oral justice, how much greater a perfect, righteous, and Holy God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down to us His moral regulation's by way of the ten command=
ments received by Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guidelines were not given=
 so we can be justified, however so that we might see the need for our savi=
our. They are the mirror of God's character of what He has put in every one=
 of us, with our conscious bearing witness that we all know that it is an o=
ffense to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We may strive to observe all the moral laws of the ten commandments, howeve=
r we will never catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. The sam=
e word of the law given to Moses became flesh over 2000 years ago within th=
e body of Jesus Christ. He was brought forth to be our justification by per=
fectly fulfilling the law, living a sinless life that solely God could fulf=
ill.<br />
<br />
The distance between us and the law can never be reconciled by our very own=
 merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God=
. And if we are to seize hold of, by way of faith in Him, He'll pull us for=
ward being the one to justify us. As within the court of law, if someone st=
eps in and pays your debt, despite the fact that you're guilty, the judge c=
an do what is legal and just and set you free. That is what Jesus did almos=
t 2000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being fulfilled w=
ithin the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood, with His last words=
 being, "...It is finished!..." (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
So why did Jesus have to die for us?<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that God is Holy and just, the wrath that belongs to us cou=
ld not be overlooked. Through the perfect righteousness and justice of God'=
s character, it must be dealt with, it must be quenched and satisfied.<br /=
>
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the demise of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). That=
 is why in Isaiah chapter 53, the place it speaks of the coming Messiah and=
 His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to cru=
sh His only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
That is due to the fact the wrath that we deserve was justified by being po=
ured out upon His Son. For if it was poured out upon us who deserve it, we'=
d all perish and go to hell. God created a way of escape by pouring it out =
on His Son who's soul could not stay in Hades, however was raised and seate=
d at the right hand of God in power.<br />
<br />
Now after we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), God no longer loo=
ks at the person who deserves His wrath, but the glorious image of His perf=
ect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we obtained the wrath we deserv=
e, making a way of escape from the curse of death.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is turn from our sins and believe in the saviour, confe=
ssing and turning from our sins. That is not just a head knowledge of belie=
ving in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart. In whi=
ch we no longer live to practice sin, however turn from our sins and practi=
ce righteousness:<br />
<br />
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? =
Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor=
 homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor =
revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were s=
ome of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were just=
ified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corint=
hians 6:9-11).<br />
<br />
By doing so we may come to be transformed into the image of God by way of f=
aith in His Son Christ Jesus Who is willing to provide the Holy Spirit to w=
hoever ask of Him:<br />
<br />
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, unless one is born of water and the =
Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh=
 is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel th=
at I said to you, 'You must be born again.' (John 3:5-6).<br />
<br />
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of Go=
d dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is no=
t His" (Romans 8:9).<br />
<br />
So what are you waiting for? Our Father in heaven only wants the best for u=
s all, restoring every little thing this world has stolen from us. That is =
what it means to be "holy". To be made whole.<br />
<br />
He's waiting to hear from you. That God given tongue to speak language, by =
using faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgive you by confessing your sins an=
d be willing to forsake them; that you receive the sacrifice of His Son Jes=
us on the cross, and that you want His Holy Spirit residing inside you rewo=
rking you into a child of the living God.<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him (the Hol=
y Spirit) will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will becom=
e in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."<br />
<br />
Did you realize that Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone else in the sc=
riptures, even more than He spoke about heaven?! For this very cause He was=
 brought forth to die for us, to save us from this place that we earned by =
our sins.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
He describes hell as a actual place where,<br />
<br />
"Their worm does not die<br />
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44).<br />
<br />
And where,<br />
<br />
"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13:28).<br />
<br />
Jesus tells us who to fear,<br />
<br />
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rath=
er fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:=
28).<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8).<img width=3D"1" height=3D"1" src=3D"http:/=
