<p>-Mechanical two-axis stabilization Pan-Tilt with a pitch angle of 110
degrees: The tilt angle is 110 degrees when using a Pan-Tilt camera.<br />
-Arms that can be folded.<br /> -GPS location mode allows for more precise
flying.<br /> -With 5G wifi capability, it can be linked to an APP or APK
system to shoot pictures/videos and send photos in real time via the mobile
phone camera.<br /> The -5G wifi fpv range can exceed 2000 m.<br /> -Follow
me: The aircraft will control the phone indefinitely and will go in the
same direction as the operator.<br /> -It can give stable flight thanks to
the altitude hold mode capability.<br /> -Because of the orbital motion,
the plane will fly in circles, offering a cooler shooting viewpoint.<br />
- Gesture recognition for photography: make a gesture facing the camera
within 1-3m of the aircraft.<br /> -In waypoint flight mode, just create a
route on the screen and use the helicopter to follow it.<br /> -Comes with
an auto-return function. When the controller signal is lost, the aircraft
will return to the takeoff location using the GPS trajectory.<br /> -The
flying time is up to 28 minutes when using a 11.4V 2850mAh battery.<br />
-Headless mode eliminates the need to change aircraft position prior to
flying.<br /> -With the one-click back function, you can simply return
home.<br /><br /><br />Would you like to take one today? Just inform he
quantity and the receiving address, and I will arrange the logistics to
ship the goods to you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jeff Knowles</p>
